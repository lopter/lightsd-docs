Developers & companies
======================

lightsd's development takes place on github: https://github.com/lopter/lightsd.

Check-out the `contribution guide`_!

If you wanna get a feel of what I'm working on you can watch my patch queue:
https://github.com/lopter/lightsd-mq. You will need to install Mercurial_ and
hg-git_ to apply it over the main repository. Some of the patches are just
snippets I put aside; the series_ file will tell you which ones.

Feel free to reach out via email or irc (kalessin on freenode, insist if I
don't reply). As the project name implies, I'm fairly interested in other smart
bulbs. If you are a company trying to use lightsd feel free to reach me out as
well. lightsd is free software under the GPLv3_ but has been designed in a way
that make it usable in closed source environments.

I'm not looking for a new job, thanks.
